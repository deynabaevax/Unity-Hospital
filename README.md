With the global outbreak of COVID-19, the global medical system faces a rigorous challenge. How to conveniently and efficiently manage patients is an urgent problem for most hospitals.
 
The Hospital Corona-patient management simulation topic was chosen by our team as the Corona issue is very relevant in everyone’s lives today and we want to create a simulation that could help hospitals predict how many people they could help in a crisis such as the corona pandemic
 
Our solution will provide the most efficient way for the patients to get to the doctor’s room to get tested, without getting in contact with non-infected people. Moreover, predicting the amount of people that could be taken care of and keeping track of them. The application will also keep track of the number of available rooms, beds and doctors available to take care of infected patients. The application could update, save and modify data and give statistics according to the one given.
